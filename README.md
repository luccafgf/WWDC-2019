# WWDC 2019
This game aims at a playful and interactive introduction to American Sign Language

## Motivation
My goal in making this playground was to work on a knowledge I was currently studying (machine learning) to create a solution that was interesting and dynamic to some existing problem. Talking with some friends about American Sign Language, I saw an opportunity to create something that could help facilitate the learning of this alphabet.
